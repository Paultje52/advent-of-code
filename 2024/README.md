This year, I will try to solve all the problems in Java. I'm a bit experienced in Java, but I'm not a professional. I'm doing this to improve my Java skills and to learn new things. I will try to write clean and efficient code, but I'm not an expert in Java. If you see any mistakes or have any suggestions, please let me know. I'm always open to feedback.

  For the distance challenge, I decided to read the input as a string. After that, the code is going through each line and adds both values in an arraylist, exactly on the correct place. Because of this, the arraylist is immediately sorted and I can just loop through all the values and calculate the distance using `Math.abs`.

  _Distance answer: 2580760_

  For the similarity, I don't have to sort the input. I'm just going through the first column and then counting how many times the number appears in the second column.

  _Similarity answer: 25358365_
